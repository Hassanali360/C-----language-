# Embedded C Programming 🚀

This repository contains my learning notes, practice programs, and concepts related to **C programming for Embedded Systems**.  
The goal is to build a **strong foundation in Embedded C** for microcontroller-based development.

## 📌 Why Embedded C?
Embedded C is widely used to program **microcontrollers and hardware systems** because it offers:
- Low-level hardware access
- High performance and efficiency
- Portability across platforms
- Fine control over memory and peripherals
